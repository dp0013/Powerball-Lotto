# Powerball-Lotto
repository for Python files related to Powerball lottery project

I conducted this project to gain more fluency with Python and familiarity with web scraping.  In addition, I gained familiarity with GitHub to help me manage versions, which was an unintended yet welcome consequence.  Future projects will involve more data science with an eye toward machine learning.
