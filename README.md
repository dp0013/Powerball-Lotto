repository for Python files related to Powerball lottery project

DISCLAIMER:  This was not intended for use in hacking the Powerball lottery in any way, shape, or form. 

This project is solely meant for the purposes of gaining more fluency with Python and familiarity with web scraping in particular.  In addition, I gained more familiarity with GitHub to help me manage versions and tkinter for using GUI interfaces to save files and run select actions.  Of note, the original programs I wrote performed the same actions; however, after learning more about regex and implementing it in my code, I was able to shave off 30 to 40 seconds for each script, making each file run in approximately only 3 seconds.  This typically involves scraping the FL Powerball Lottery website to return the raw html, culling the 1023 winning PB number combinations and their respective dates, separating the PB numbers from the other 5 winning numbers, and then running pandas DataFrame to rank them based on frequency.  In addition, the dates and winning combos are output to csv files while other data can be generated -- and still other results can be written -- to text file via pushbutton.  I had a lot of fun working on this and learned a vast amount in only a few short weeks!

Future projects will involve more data science with an eye toward machine learning.
